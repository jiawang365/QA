Lab Exercise: Visual Testing of a Web Page Using BrowserStack's Screenshots
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Create a free trial account on [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/start#os=Windows&os_version=10&browser=Firefox&browser_version=45.0&zoom_to_fit=true&full_screen=true&resolution=responsive-mode&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F%3Fgws_rd%3Dssl&speed=1). Use the Screenshots feature to check a page from any of our testing sites on a variety of platforms. Inspect the individual screenshots to look for bugs. If you find a problem, try reproducing it using the BrowserStack Live feature. If the bug is reproducible in Live, then file a Bugzilla report about it (assuming one doesn't already exist!).

To submit your assignment, convert your BrowserStack Live results to a .pdf file and upload it via Catalyst.
