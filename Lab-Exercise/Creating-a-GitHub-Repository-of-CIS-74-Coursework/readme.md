Lab Exercise: Creating a GitHub Repository of CIS-74 Coursework
-------------------------------------------


Many employment recruiters "check out" a potential candidate via several public online sources, such as LinkedIn and GitHub. Thus, a GitHub repo containing evidence of one's QA experience and skills is an excellent "tool" in obtaining and/or maintaining one's career in QA. 

For this lab exercise, you are to build a bigger and better GitHub repository than in your last lab exercise. It should contain as much of your work as you are willing to have viewable by the public! Select amongst your: lab exercises, in-class exercises, midterm exam Selenium problem, Meetup review, Bugzilla reports, TDS/TPS planning documents, TestRail test cases, and final exam Selenium problem. 

Since both our Bugzilla and TestRail installations are likely to disappear soon after the course is over, you'll need to store your work there as something other than URLs! For Bugzilla, you can:  

•Do a search to bring up your five best bugs.  

•Select the Long Format button.  

•Save the resulting report as a .pdf.  

•Add the .pdf to your repo.  

I am in the process of creating a somewhat similar repo of my own. Mine won't have a Meetup review or a TDS/TPS document, but it will have the actual assignment instructions as they appeared on our Catalyst site plus all of the Selenium code I produced for your lab exercises and exam problems. I suggest you look at it to get ideas for your own GitHub repo.

As one of ten lab exercises, which cumulatively are worth 10% of your course grade, this lab exercise is worth a mere 1% of your course grade. But it may be the most impactful on your future QA success of all of the work you've done in CIS 74 this quarter! So, do your best to create a clear, clean, well-organized, well-written "profile" of your work! 

Tip: A nicely formatted README.md in every dir would go a long way towards making your repo a good one!  

Another tip: There are several Markdown editors online which can help you format your README.md files nicely before you ever add them to your GitHub repo. I'm currently using DILLINGER.

To submit this exercise, simply send me the  URL of your repo for this course. Please make it a clickable link via using the hyperlink tool.
