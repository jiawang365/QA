Lab Exercise: Modifying a Selenium/WebDriver/Pytest Test Case
---------------------------------------------------------------


In this exercise, you will be exposed to Selenium/WebDriver with Python test case automation via a simple modification of a test case written by me. Your main challenge will probably be installation of all the components needed to run my test!

•Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/getting-started.html), and the Selenium/WebDriver [Python bindings](http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/) on your computer.  
•Run my test--A-links.py. Do not proceed to the next step until you have my test case working!   
•Modify my test to work for the 8 links you were assigned for our 05/02 in-class exercise.  

To submit this lab exercise, upload your single .py file containing the test case.
