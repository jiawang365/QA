Lab Exercise: Chapter 6 Practice 1a
-----------------------------------------


Do Practice exercise 1.a. at the end of chapter 6 (page 91), using the allpairs program. To submit the assignment, upload two files:   

•your input file (test.txt or similarly named file), and  

•the output from running allpairs.pl with that input file.  
HINT: My output from *allpairs.pl* specified *30* test cases. So, if you come up with a different number, review your solution for correctness. Of course, it's always possible that I did something wrong! If your number is different and you think it is correct, start a discussion on our Forum to see what number other people are getting.


Instructor's comments:  
------------------------
Please learn how to create an output file from running a program via a command line! With Linux on a Mac, the command would be:  


*perl allpairs.pl jiawang.txt > allpairs.output *   

And I believe that works on Windows also if you run it from a Command window.  

You copy/pasted the output into all one column of a spreadsheet, which makes no sense AND is hard to read. If you can copy/paste into a spreadsheet, you should also be able to copy/paste into a Notepad file which would also be better.
