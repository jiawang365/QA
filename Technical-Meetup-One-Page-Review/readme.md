Technical Meetup One-Page Review
----------------------------------


Write a one-page (double-spaced!) review of a technical Meetup presentation related to testing, software quality assurance, etc. It would be best if you could actually attend a local Meetup and write up your review based on the presentation there. But if you prefer, you can write the review about a past Meetup, a recording of which has been posted; this is the case for many of them.

If you aren't familiar with [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/), I heartily recommend that you register and search for local Meetups related to your career interests.

If you aren't familiar with formal reviews (of books, films, music, technical products, etc.), I heartily recommend that you read several reviews before you start writing your own review.

Your reviews will be graded based on:  

•A concise summary of the presentation's content, including its title  

•Inclusion of the date of the presentation  
•Inclusion of the name of the speaker and a sentence or two about him or her  
•Your opinions of the presentation's content and delivery, along with the basis of those opinions  

•An absence of spelling, punctuation, and grammatical errors. You are allowed and even encouraged to review each other's review (redundancy intended!) in order to submit as good a review as possible. You are also encouraged to read your presentation out loud and slowly in order to "hear" as many errors as possible. WARNING: Your instructor is very intolerant of writing errors! So, do your best to make as few of them as possible!   

Feedback
---------------
Interesting selection of talk topic!   

Feedback for next time:  

•Give URL of recording  

•Give more specific info about speaker's background  
•Specify date and sponsoring organization (Philadelphia Software Testing Group Meetup).  

•Give your opinion on the content, the speaker's delivery, and the overall usefulness of the talk.  

•Write in full sentences and paragraphs. Your review is halfway between notes and a review, style-wise. For example, the snippet below may look like two sentences at first glance but in fact, neither period-ended phrase is a full sentence.   




Comparing the risk and value at each step. (Style of approach: supportive and consultive).
